    <section>
      <h2>Git basics</h2>
      <p><strong>git remote add</strong> links your local repo to an online repo (commonly named <code>origin</code>), enabling push/pull. <strong>git push</strong> uploads commits to the remote; <strong>git pull</strong> downloads and merges remote changes into your local branch.</p>
      <p><strong>Clone</strong> downloads a repository to your machine. <strong>Fork</strong> creates your own copy of someone else's repo on GitHub to work independently.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pull Requests &amp; Code Review</h2>
      <p>A Pull Request (PR) is how you propose merging one branch into another (usually into <code>main</code>). Teammates review changed lines, add comments, and request fixes. Push new commits to your branch to update the PR; once approved it’s merged and the branch can be deleted.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Issues, Comments &amp; Task Assignment</h2>
      <p>Issues track bugs, features, or questions with a title, description, labels, assignees, and comments. Use comments for discussion and screenshots. Assign tasks to people to avoid duplicated work and include Markdown task lists to track progress.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create Issue → assign → fix in branch → open PR → merge → close Issue.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Documentation &amp; README</h2>
      <p>A good README contains a clear title, short intro, installation &amp; usage steps, contributor guidelines, optional demo/diagram, and known issues. Project docs (a docs folder, API refs, contribution guides, license) help others use and contribute to your project.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Markdown essentials</h2>
      <p>Markdown formats docs and content on GitHub. Common features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Headings: <code># H1</code>, <code>## H2</code>, <code>### H3</code></li>
        <li>Bold/Italic: <code>**bold**</code>, <code>*italic*</code>, <code>***both***</code></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Portfolio note</h2>
      <p>A portfolio should present who you are, highlight your best projects (with links), list skills, and include contact info. Well-documented GitHub projects make excellent portfolio pieces.</p>
