# linux-week1-project
This project is a simple web page that summarizes key concepts in Git and GitHub i learned this week. 

# Overview
I created this project as part of my Week 1 Linux and Git learning journey. It brings together everything I learned throughout the week and organizes it into simple, easy-to-read web pages. Each day’s folder contains notes, summaries, or lessons on Git and GitHub topics like commits, branches, pull requests, issues, cloning vs. forking, and documentation.
It’s built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showing how these files work together to form a small learning project.

# Features
*Clean and responsive layout*
The page is divided into clear sections that explain every task and topics for each day.

*Simple styling*
The design uses colors, a card layout, light effects, and adjusts nicely on smaller screens.

*Small JavaScript interaction*
Clicking the card gives a short glow effect, and the script logs when the page loads.

# How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the project to your computer.
2.Open any of the HTML files in your browser. Example:
commands.html, day1/lessons.html, day2/summary.html, or day3-5/notes.html.
No setup needed. Just open the files and explore each day’s work.

# Project Goals
This project helps you to
- Connect a local repo to GitHub using git remote add
- Use git push and git pull
- Know difference between cloning and forking
- Create and review pull requests
- Work with GitHub Issues and task assignments
- Write clear documentation and READMEs
- Basic front-end structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


# Lessons Learned
Throughout the project, I learned:
- How Git tracks changes using commits and branches
- How to safely push and pull code without losing progress
- How teams collaborate through pull requests, reviews, and issues
- How proper documentation makes a project easier to understand
- How to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into organized folders
- How to structure a small project in a way that grows over time

# Contributing
If you’d like to improve the project, please open an Issue or send a Pull Request. Some nice ideas you could work on include:
- Adding light/dark mode
- Improving the animations
- Creating a simple navigation menu
- Expanding it into a small multi-page documentation site
